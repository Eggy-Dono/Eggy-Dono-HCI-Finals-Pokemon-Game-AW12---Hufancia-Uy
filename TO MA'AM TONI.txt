To Miss Toni,

All the provided code are authentically made by us two through heavy referencing from past activities and lessons taught in the subject, templates and tutorials online, as well as guidance from family members with professions in tech, lest for the instance wherein we used pre-asseted code provided on online manuals and websites exclusively for making advanced attributes (gusto po namin pagandahin ng bongga kasi, but had to use premade code snippets for some parts to make that possible). 

Ex. The Gameboy intro and soundeffects

Other such assets we used like images, gifs, and bgms were found on the internet, and we do not hold accounts of property on any of them, except for the utilization used on them.
